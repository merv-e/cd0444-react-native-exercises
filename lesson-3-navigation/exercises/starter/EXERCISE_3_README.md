# Lesson 3 Exercise 2

No code is provided here because the exercise starts a new React Native app from scratch.

### Getting Started
Select the Blank option from React Native setup steps.

### Exercise Instructions
In this exercise you will set up your own nested tab and stack navigation. Feel free to put placeholder content in all the screens, right now we are focusing on stubbing out our screens in navigation. You can choose your own screens, or copy the animals and habitats setup I had in the video.

- Create a tab navigation with two or three tabs
- Create Stack navigator branches for each tab, each stack navigation element should have at least two screens
- Add link buttons to move between the nested screens
