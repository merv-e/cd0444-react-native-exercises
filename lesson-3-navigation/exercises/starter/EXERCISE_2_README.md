# Lesson 3 Exercise 2

No code is provided here because the exercise starts a new React Native app from scratch.

### Getting Started
Select the Blank option from React Native setup steps or re-use code from the previous challenge.

### Exercise Instructions
Change the Stack style navigation you created in the last challenge to be either tab or drawer style navigation.

- Convert stack navigation to either drawer or tab navigation style
- Install the correct supporting libraries for your choice of navigation
- Customize your navigation in some way (add icons, change the styles, give screens custom names, etc...)
