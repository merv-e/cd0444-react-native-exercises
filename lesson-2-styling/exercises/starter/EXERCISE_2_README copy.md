# Lesson 2 Exercise 2

Base code for exercise 2 is based off the code for exercise 1, or a new Expo project

### Getting Started
Select the Blank option from React Native setup steps.

### Exercise Instructions
Test your Flexobx chops with the actions below. You can edit the screen you made in the previous exercise or create a new one. The colored squares below are an opportunity for you to experiment with as many flex variations as you want and very quickly see the effects visually. 
- Left align a 200x200px yellow square in the top left corner of the screen
- Center align a 100x100 blue square in the center of the screen (vertically and horizontally centered)
- Right align a 150x150 green square in the bottom right corner of the screen
