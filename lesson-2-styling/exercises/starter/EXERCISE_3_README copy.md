# Lesson 2 Exercise 3

Base code for exercise 2 is based off the code for exercise 1, or a new Expo project

### Getting Started
Select the Blank option from React Native setup steps or re-use your code from the previous challenge.

### Exercise Instructions
In this exercise, make a new component or take the screen components you've made in the previous exercises and turn them into folders with their own style files.
- Create a styles file for a component
- Import StyleSheets in the styles file
- Create a function that returns the styles and call it in the index file
- Add styles to the stylesheet and call them in the index file as shown in the previous video
- See your styles appearing in your component

### Extra Challenge
The reason we use a function for styles is so that they can be dynamic! Styles often need to change based on other logic, using functions to support these dynamic styles is one way we can make our app ready for real world complexity.
