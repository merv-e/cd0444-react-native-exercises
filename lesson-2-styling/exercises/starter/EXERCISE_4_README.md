# Lesson 2 Exercise 3

Base code for exercise 2 is based off the code for exercise 1, or a new Expo project

### Getting Started
Select the Blank option from React Native setup steps.

### Exercise Instructions
Create a style guide that includes the following:
- A SafeView component
- A ScrollView component
- At least one View component
- An Image component
- At least one Text component
- Use styles to make some text italics
- Use styles to make some text bold
- Use styles to make some text underlined
- Use Flexbox to send one box/content section to the right
- Use Flexbox to send one box/content section to the left
- Use Flexbox to center one box/content section

### Extra Challenge
The reason we use a function for styles is so that they can be dynamic! Styles often need to change based on other logic, using functions to support these dynamic styles is one way we can make our app ready for real world complexity.
